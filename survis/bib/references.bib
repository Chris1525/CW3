  abstract = {The rapid growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the 21st century has resulted in the emergence of a novel technological paradigm; known as the Internet of Things, or IoT. The IoT, which is at the heart of today's smart infrastructure, aids in the creation of a ubiquitous network of things by simplifying interconnection between smart digital devices and enabling Machine to Machine (M2M) communication. As of now, there are numerous examples of IoT use cases available, assisting every person in this world towards making their lives easier and more convenient. The latest advancement of IoT in a variety of domains such as healthcare, smart city, smart agriculture has led to an exponential growth of cyber-attacks that targets these pervasive IoT environments, which can even lead to jeopardizing the lives of people; that is involved with it. In general, this IoT can be considered as every digital object that is connected to the Internet for intercommunication. Hence in this regard to analyze cyber threats that come through the Internet, here we are doing an experimental evaluation to analyze the requests, received to exploit the opened Secure Shell (SSH) connection service of an IoT device, which in our case a Raspberry Pi devices, which connected to the Internet for more than six consecutive days. By opening the SSH service on Raspberry Pi, it acts as a Honeypot device where we can log and retrieve all login attempt requests received to the SSH service opened. Inspired by evaluating the IoT security attacks that target objects in the pervasive IoT environment, after retrieving all the login requests made through the open SSH connection we then provide a comprehensive analysis along with our observations about the origin of the requests and the focus areas of intruders; in this study.

  abstract = {In recent years, ‘Cyber Security’ has emerged as a widely-used term with increased adoption by practitioners and politicians alike. However, as with many fashionable jargon, there seems to be very little understanding of what the term really entails. Although this is may not be an issue when the term is used in an informal context, it can potentially cause considerable problems in context of organizational strategy, business objectives, or international agreements. In this work, we study the existing literature to identify the main definitions provided for the term ‘Cyber Security’ by authoritative sources. We then conduct various lexical and semantic analysis techniques in an attempt to better understand the scope and context of these definitions, along with their relevance. Finally, based on the analysis conducted, we propose a new improved definition that we then demonstrate to be a more representative definition using the same lexical and semantic analysis techniques.

  abstract = {Due to voluminous malware attacks in the cyberspace, machine learning has become popular for automating malware detection and classification. In this work we play devil's advocate by investigating a new type of threats aimed at deceiving multi-class Portable Executable (PE) malware classifiers into targeted misclassification with practical adversarial samples. Using a malware dataset with tens of thousands of samples, we construct three types of PE malware classifiers, the first one based on frequencies of opcodes in the disassembled malware code (opcode classifier), the second one the list of API functions imported by each PE sample (API classifier), and the third one the list of system calls observed in dynamic execution (system call classifier). We develop a genetic algorithm augmented with different support functions to deceive these classifiers into misclassifying a PE sample into any target family. Using an Rbot malware sample whose source code is publicly available, we are able to create practical adversarial samples that can deceive the opcode classifier into targeted misclassification with a successful rate of 75%, the API classifier with a successful rate of 83.3%, and the system call classifier with a successful rate of 91.7%.

  abstract = {Cloud computing allows the deployment and delivery of application services for users worldwide. Software as a Service providers with limited upfront budget can take advantage of Cloud computing and lease the required capacity in a pay-as-you-go basis, which also enables flexible and dynamic resource allocation according to service demand. One key challenge potential Cloud customers have before renting resources is to know how their services will behave in a set of resources and the costs involved when growing and shrinking their resource pool. Most of the studies in this area rely on simulation-based experiments, which consider simplified modeling of applications and computing environment. In order to better predict service's behavior on Cloud platforms, we developed an integrated architecture that is based on both simulation and emulation. The proposed architecture, named EMUSIM, automatically extracts information from application behavior via emulation and then uses this information to generate the corresponding simulation model. We performed experiments using an image processing application as a case study and found that EMUSIM was able to accurately model such application via emulation and use the model to supply information about its potential performance in a Cloud provider. We also discuss our experience using EMUSIM for deploying applications in a real public Cloud provider. EMUSIM is based on an open source software stack and therefore it can be extended for analysis behavior of several other applications. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

  abstract = {Smart grids utilize communication technologies that make them vulnerable to cyber attacks. The power grid is a critical infrastructure that constitutes a tempting target for sophisticated and well-equipped attackers. In this paper we simulate three malware types capable of attacking smart grid networks in the ns3 simulation environment. First, an aggressive malware type, named the pandemic malware, follows a topological-scan strategy to find and infect all devices on the network in the shortest time possible, via a brute force approach. Next, the more intelligent endemic malware sacrifices speed for stealthiness and operates with a less conspicuous hit-list and permutation-scan strategy. Finally, a highly stealthy malware type called the contagion malware does not scan the network or initiate any connections but rather appends on legitimate communication flows. We define several metrics to express the infection speed, scanning efficiency, stealthiness, and complexity of malware and use those metrics to compare the three malware types. Our simulations provide details on the scanning and propagation behavior of different malware classes. Furthermore, this work allows the assessment of the detectability of different malware types.

  abstract = {The generative adversarial network (GAN) had been successfully applied in many domains in the past, the GAN network provides a new approach for solving computer vision, object detection and classification problems by learning, mimicking and generating any distribution of data. One of the difficulties in deep learning-based malware detection and classification tasks is lacking of training malware samples. With insufficient training data the classification performance of the deep model could be compromised significantly. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a method which uses the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic malware samples. Our experiment results show that by using the DCGAN generated adversarial synthetic malware samples, the classification accuracy of the classifier - a 18-layer deep residual network is significantly improved by approximately 6%.

  abstract = {It is becoming increasingly necessary for organizations to have a cyber threat
intelligence capability and a key component of success for any such capability is
information sharing with partners, peers and others they select to trust. While cyber
threat intelligence and information sharing can help focus and prioritize the use of the
immense volumes of complex cyber security information organizations face today, they
have a foundational need for standardized, structured representations of this information
to make it tractable. The Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX™) is a quickly
evolving, collaborative community-driven effort to define and develop a language to
represent structured threat information. The STIX language is meant to convey the full
range of cyber threat information and strives to be fully expressive, flexible, extensible,
automatable, and as human-readable as possible. Though relatively new and still
evolving, it is actively being adopted or considered for adoption by a wide range of cyber
threat-related organizations and communities around the world. All interested parties
are welcome to participate in evolving STIX as part of its open, collaborative community
via the STIX web site, email discussion lists and other collaborative forums.

  abstract = {Today's cyber attacks require a new line of security defenses. The static approach of traditional security based on heuristic and signature does not match the dynamic nature of new generation of threats that are known to be evasive, resilient and complex. Organizations need to gather and share real-time cyber threat information and to transform it to threat intelligence in order to prevent attacks or at least execute timely disaster recovery. Threat Intelligence (TI) means evidence-based knowledge representing threats that can inform decisions. There is a general awareness for the need of threat intelligence while vendors today are rushing to provide a diverse array of threat intelligence products, specifically focusing on Technical Threat Intelligence (TTI). Although threat intelligence is being increasingly adopted, there is little consensus on what it actually is, or how to use it. Without any real understanding of this need, organizations risk investing large amounts of time and money without solving existing security problems. Our paper aims to classify and make distinction among existing threat intelligence types. We focus particularly on the TTI issues, emerging researches, trends and standards. Our paper also explains why there is a reluctance among organizations to share threat intelligence. We provide sharing strategies based on trust and anonymity, so participating organizations can do away with the risks of business leak. We also show in this paper why having a standardized representation of threat information can improve the quality of TTI, thus providing better automated analytics solutions on large volumes of TTI which are often non-uniform and redundant. Finally, we evaluate most popular open source/free threat intelligence tools, and compare their features with those of a new AlliaCERT TI tool.

  abstract = {Social engineering, due in part to the increasing popularity and advancements in information technology and ubiquity of devices, has emerged as one of the most challenging cyber security threats in the contemporary age. In the context of cyber security, social engineering is the practice of taking advantage of human weaknesses through manipulation to accomplish a malicious goal. This literature review identifies various social engineering cyber security threats in diverse environments. Exploiting humans as the weakest security link in such environments, as opposed to technical vulnerabilities and system protocols, has led to increased calls for raising information security awareness among users. One of the most straightforward solutions is through effective training and education programs. As such, the paper details how innovative information security education programs can effectively increase user/employee awareness and ultimately reduce cyber security incidents.
